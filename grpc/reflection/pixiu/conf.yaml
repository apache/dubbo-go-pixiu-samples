# gRPC Server Reflection Demo - Default Configuration
# ============================================================
# This configuration demonstrates the gRPC Server Reflection
# feature with the "reflection" mode enabled.
#
# For other modes, see:
#   - conf-passthrough.yaml: Binary pass-through (default, high performance)
#   - conf-reflection.yaml:  Full dynamic decoding via reflection
#   - conf-hybrid.yaml:      Reflection with passthrough fallback
# ============================================================
