# ============================================================
# HYBRID MODE Configuration
# ============================================================
# This mode combines passthrough and reflection approaches.
# It attempts to use reflection for message decoding but falls
# back to passthrough if reflection fails or is unavailable.
# Best for mixed environments with varying reflection support.
